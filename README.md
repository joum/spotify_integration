# Spotify Integration
###### Jo√£o Machado interview exercise - Drupal Developer

### Install

- Install as you would any other module: _find a way to place it in the modules folder_.
- Enable the module via Drupal's UI or `drush en spotify_integration`.
- Go to `/admin/config/system/spotify-settings` and set up your Spotify API credentials.
- Afterwards, go to the Block Layout page (or any other tool that uses blocks for that matter), and click on __Place Block__. Be sure to specify how many artists should be displayed in the block.
- Visit the page where your block has been placed.
- When clicking an Artist's name on the block, you'll be directed to a page displaying some of that artist's Spotify profile info.
